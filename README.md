## Introduction

This project is intended to be a simple Snake Clone in C++ (Hence the name Cnake) for learning purposes, to get familiar with C++ Game Development, the Vulkan Graphics API and Game Engine Development. I plan to expand on it with some features and/or changes compared to the classic Snake gameplay loop. 

Progress tracking available here: [Project Overview](https://github.com/users/FlyMandi/projects/1)
