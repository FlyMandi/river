## Introduction

This project is intended to be a simple Snake Clone in C++ (Hence the name Cnake) for learning purposes, to get familiar with C++ Game Development, the Vulkan Graphics API and Game Engine Development. I might expand on it with some features and/or changes compared to the classic Snake gameplay loop. Along the way, I'll be documenting knowledge I find valuable, especially that which isn't all too clear in other available documentation.
