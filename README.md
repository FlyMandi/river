## Introduction

This project is intended to be a simple Snake Clone in C++ (Hence the name Cnake) for learning purposes, to get familiar with C++ Game Development, the GODOT engine and Vulkan Graphics API. I might expand on it with some features and/or changes compared to the classic Snake gameplay loop. Along the way, I'll be documenting knowledge I find valuable, especially that which isn't all to clear in say, the official GODOT documentation.
