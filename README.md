## Introduction

This project is intended to be a simple Snake Clone in C++ (Hence the name Cnake) for learning purposes, to get familiar with C++ Game Development, the Vulkan Graphics API and Game Engine Development. I might expand on it with some features and/or changes compared to the classic Snake gameplay loop. Along the way, I'll be documenting knowledge I find valuable, especially that which isn't all too clear in other available documentation.

## Project Resources

These are all my tools of choice to build this project.

#### C++

C++ is not only a language that I was already partly familiar with, but also a great language that facilitates low-level control, while not making you manage all of the memory manually, so it's fairly easy to build a memory-safe application. I want to get better at C++ within Game Development, specifically.

#### Vulkan

I chose the Vulkan API since I'd read that you can gain quite a significant amount of control over the performance of the application. Plus, my goal is to learn Vulkan in order to use it to build larger-scale 3D applications.

#### Libraries

I'm using GFLW to draw and manage the window, since it makes my life easier and I don't have to touch Win32.

GLM is what I've ran with for graphics arithmetics operations.


#### Building with PreMake
